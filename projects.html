                <img src="./media/neuroscience_vr_project.png" alt="Neuroscience VR Project Image">
                <p>In a neuroscience lab, I developed software for VR experiments , which included setting up both physical and virtual environments. My work involved designing various virtual worlds, programming the logic using Teensy and MATLAB, and analyzing the data collected from these experiments. This project was pivotal in advancing VR applications in neuroscience research.</p>
