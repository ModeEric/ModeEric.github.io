A journey through academia, bridging cutting-edge research with real-world applications.

## Highlights

- Published **ORBIT** dataset curation methodology (ACL Findings 2024) and contributed to **SIGIR LiveRAG** workshop work.
- Improved domain performance on **MMLU (astronomy)** from **69% → 76%** via targeted data selection.
- Built cost-efficient, reproducible **dataset curation** pipelines and released artifacts to the community.
- Hands-on with **GPU acceleration**, **distributed training**, and **IR/NLP** evaluation at scale.
