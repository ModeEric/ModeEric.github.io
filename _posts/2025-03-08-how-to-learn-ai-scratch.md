AI is a vast yet incredibly valuable field, especially for those interested in building products or conducting research. While plenty of resources cover theoretical aspects, fewer focus on developing intuition for AI. In this post, I’ll discuss why intuition is essential for learning AI effectively and share some methods that have helped me cultivate it.

## Why Intuition Matters

Over time, I’ve come to strongly believe that intelligence is a skill that can be developed. Intelligence can be defined as the efficient retrieval and composition of facts and ideas. For example, learning a new language involves identifying key words and phrases and encoding only the most essential elements in our memory. The easier it becomes to access and apply that knowledge, the more fluent we appear. Similarly, developing intelligence involves improving the efficiency of our understanding and expanding our ability to grasp new concepts.

Intuition, by definition, is the ability to understand complex ideas without relying solely on formal reasoning or extensive analysis. It serves as a powerful tool for intelligent decision-making. Without delving too much into neuroscience, intuition minimizes cognitive effort, enabling us to solve problems more quickly and effectively. A strong intuition allows us to work more efficiently, freeing up mental resources for deeper exploration and problem-solving.

## How to Develop Intuition

The good news is that intuition can be learned and improved through practice. While some people may have a natural inclination or upbringing that enhances their intuition in specific areas, anyone can cultivate it through intentional effort. A structured approach to improving intuition is known as "deliberate practice," a concept introduced by [Anders Ericsson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deliberate_practice). Deliberate practice involves carefully designing exercises that target specific skills to accelerate learning and mastery. Put succinctly, practice exactly what you want to improve. I will list some examples in the section on developing intuition for AI.

## How to Develop Intuition for AI 

First, you need to determine exactly what you want to learn. I will go over two examples in this post:

1. How to conduct state-of-the-art research in AI
2. How to build cutting-edge AI code

These two skills are complementary, and having both will make you a well-rounded AI researcher.

### How to Conduct State-of-the-Art Research in AI

Keeping in mind that you want to use deliberate practice, you must identify precisely what aspect of research you want to improve. If you want to enhance your understanding of the latest research, practice reading recent papers in your field of interest. Some websites for finding recent papers are [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/) and [PapersWithCode](https://paperswithcode.com/). I recommend starting with PapersWithCode because it has a more user-friendly interface and pre-filters papers by popularity. Setting a daily goal, such as reading one paper per day, can be beneficial.

While reading, choose an intention to focus on for improvement. For example, if you want to learn how to write research papers, analyze the paper’s structure, style, language, and figures. If you want to learn how to generate novel ideas, explicitly identify:

1. What limitations existed before the paper
2. What limitations the paper addresses
3. What limitations still remain

By following these steps, you can pause after step 1 and attempt to come up with the solutions outlined in step 2 yourself. If you struggle, give yourself a hint by referring to the abstract or introduction. Repeating this process over time strengthens your ability to understand state-of-the-art work and generate your own research ideas.

### How to Build Cutting-Edge AI Code

The same approach applies to coding. Start by identifying the specific skills you want to improve. For instance, if you want to learn how to implement an algorithm from a new research paper that lacks code, follow this process:

1. Find an existing implementation of a research paper.
2. Read the paper thoroughly.
3. Try implementing the algorithm yourself without looking at the code.
4. Compare your implementation with the existing code.

This method can be enhanced by using tools like ChatGPT for guidance or debugging. The key is to focus on problem-solving and iterative improvement rather than passive learning.

## Conclusion

This approach may seem overly simple, like I’m just telling you to "practice" when you’ve already tried that. But that’s precisely the point. The key is to be **very** intentional about what you practice. By focusing on exercises that directly improve your intuition,rather than passive methods like memorizing flashcards or watching AI videos while scrolling on your phone, you will significantly enhance your intuition and, in turn, develop a deep, practical understanding of AI.
